    "In this notebook we explore how to train an agent to play the \"CartPole\"-game, i.e. they are given a cart with a pole attached to it and it is their task to balance the pole for as long as possible. The code is largely inspired by [this](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning) repository. The accompanying [blogpost](https://keon.io/deep-q-learning/) explains some of the mathematical background.\n",
